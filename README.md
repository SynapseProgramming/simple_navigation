## Testing Tools guide

Testing robots is a pretty tedious task. There are hundreds of variables to tune, and each variable has some impact on the robotâ€™s performance. Furthermore, it is pretty hard to analyse data while the robot is running. 
This guide would highlight some key features of ros2 which would enable us developers to test robots more efficiently.

### Prerequisites
This guide assumes that you have already installed ros2 and the ros2labview_examples package.

### ROS2 BAG
The (ros2 bag) command line tool is used to record and playback messages which were  published to certain topics.<br>

```
 ros2 bag record -o <name of bag file> <topic(1)> <topic(2)> <topic(n)>
```

1. Firstly, open a new terminal and run the following command.
```
ros2 run ros2labview_examples pub_int32
```

2. Next, open a new window and run the following command to record the messages published by pub_int32

```
ros2 bag record -o bag_example /rosint
```

Ros2 bag would begin to record all messages which are being published to the /rosint topic.<br>

3. To stop recording, enter ctrl+c in the terminal of ros2 bag. The bag file would be saved in the current directory of the terminal.<br>

4. Next, close the terminal of the pub_int32 node.
5. Next, open a new terminal and run the following command to play back messages which were recorded by the bag file.
```
ros2 bag play bag_example/
```
6. Next, open  a new terminal and run the following command to view the int32 messages which were recorded by the bag file.
```
ros2 topic echo /rosint
```

### LOG files

Log files are generated by ros2 programs whenever they are executed. Log files could be used for debugging programs.<br>
Log files are stored in the ~/.ros folder.  To access log files, open a new terminal and key in the following command:<br>
```
cd  ~/.ros/log
ls
```
You can use your favourite text editor to view the log files.<br>
### Clearing LOG files
If you intend to view the log files after navigation, I would highly recommend that you clear all of the logs in the log folder before launching navigation. 
This would make it easier to find the log files which were generated during navigation.<br>

Open a new terminal and run the following set of commands.
```
cd ~/.ros
rm -rf log
mkdir log
```
### Copying log files to another location
If you would want to copy the log file to another destination, please open a new terminal and run the following commands.
```
cd ~/.ros
cp -rf log <destination file path>
```
